#### The one that cleans up some c++ linking issues

* New: LootItem and PlaceItemIntoSlot now attempt to stack items into other items that allow stacking.  Both may return false now if the item was partially added to the inventory.
* New: SwapItemSlots now accepts empty item slots as valid swap targets
* Fix: Added ARCINVENTORY_API to a number of constants and the native tags
* Fix: Fixed a linux linker error in unity builds caused by reusing a same name.  This only occours on clang.
