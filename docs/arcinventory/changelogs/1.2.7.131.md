#### The one that stops loops from going infinite

* Added a OnRep functions for all replicated properties to UArcItemStack.  They can be overriden by child classes
* Fixed a case where GetPreviousValidActiveItemSlot and GetNextValidActiveItemSlot could get stuck in an infinite loop if you tried to find the next valid item slot when you didn't have an item active.
