# Uncharted 4

### Supraland

- simple game, easy to pickup
- many systems underdeveloped: combat, exploration, progression - everything oversimplified and dull
- puzzles, secret are fine but often obscured (lack of vision guidance)

### Journey to the savage planet

- exploration is tedious, boring - waste of time, gives mostly collectables you can use for upgrades but there is little to explore for real, markers for secrets are wasted potential which could be cool part of the game
- combat and controls are straight up bad - lag on controller input, enemies are boring
