# Junky Games

### Supraland

- simple game, easy to pickup
- many systems underdeveloped (boring and clunky): combat, exploration, progression - everything oversimplified and dull
- puzzles, secret are fine but often obscured (lack of vision guidance)

### Journey to the savage planet

- exploration is tedious, boring - waste of time, gives mostly collectables you can use for upgrades but there is little to explore for real, markers for secrets are wasted potential which could be cool part of the game
- combat and controls are straight up bad - lag on controller input, enemies are boring

### Grime

- dull combat, similar to dark souls
- rough and boring traversal

### Teslagrad

- nice art and story at first
- bad controls, too slow deceleration
- problem with puzzle physics - imprecise input (floaty output but requires precise output)
- often boring, unfunny
