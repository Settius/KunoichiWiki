# Yoku's Island Express

- resource from "plaing" pinball - built into environment with lots of variations
- fast travel unlocked by money
- closed sections with puzzles
- utility gated
- character slingshot 
- tedious and boring platformer segments
- long trips between objectives, hidden items - often mixed with bugs related to umbigous traverse
