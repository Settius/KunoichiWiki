Welcome to the Arc Teams Documentation Portal!



## Description

Arc Teams is a networked multiplayer solution that allows for the creation of Teams and other segmentation methods for players.


Arc Teams was built from the ground up to support networked multiplayer games. It powers multiple games, each with different styles of segmenting players. ArcTeams supports both runtime and design time Team Definitions, allowing you to create any type of Team. 


Arc Teams also supports a concept of “Sub Teams”, which are teams within teams. This can be used to further segment players into Squads, Fireteams, Guilds, Factions, or whatever you need for your game. Arc Teams has a small development footprint and integrates simply into any code base. Simply override a few functions in GameMode and add a component to PlayerState, then it works!
